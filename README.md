# whoyou.id

Operational runbook for stabilizing the Flutter/Android toolchain used by the **whoyou.id** app.

- Read the [Flutter Android Build Troubleshooting Guide](docs/flutter_troubleshooting.md) when the Java engine crashes, `dart pub get` loops, or the Android emulator refuses to boot.
- Capture the outputs of `flutter doctor -v`, `flutter pub get`, and any failing Gradle tasks and feed them into an AI copilot to accelerate root cause discovery.
- Evaluate blockchain-backed artifact registries for verifying downloaded dependencies before they enter regulated identity workflows.
